lifeguard 0.2
December 10, 2007

http://code.google.com/p/lifeguard

This is a simple API to access Amazon's SQS and EC2 web services. It uses the QUERY interface and patterns the methods after those available from Amazon in their SOAP client for these services. This code is thread-safe and works very reliably to the best of my knowledge. I've been using it on a system where sending messages in SQS is critical and we manage pools of servers in EC2.
